LCS Recursive: The recursive algorithm finds the longest common subsequence by comparing elements and exploring different sequence possibilities. This recursive approach ensures we explore all possible subsequences to find the longest common subsequence by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.


Coin Change Recursive: The recursive solution for the coin change problem calculates how many ways you can make a certain amount using different coin denominations. The solution counts the number of ways to reach the target amount by summing the outcomes by including and excluding each coin, effectively covering all potential arrangements.
